-- TRON USDT supply for the address below is negative to begin with, this means its first transfer is out 
-- not in, the data at the beginning of tron is pretty iffy and the block explorer seems to fail the closer you
-- get to the genesis block. it is only max negative by $10 over its history so I am giving it an inital supply of 10000000/1e6 USDT
